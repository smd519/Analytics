# Data Analytics Methods
We explor different data analytics technique to turn raw data into useful, actionable insights:


## [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/smd519/Analytics/blob/main/LogisticRegression.md): 
 For categrzing credit score base don German Credit Data
 
## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/smd519/Analytics/blob/main/LinearRegression.md): 
To investigate the relationship between crime rate and environmental factors  using aggregate data on 47 states of the USA for 1960  
 
## [CUSUM](https://github.com/smd519/Analytics/blob/main/CUSUM_for_Change_Detection.md): 
 To investigate if summer season is getting longer using weather records for Atlanta from 1996 through 2015
 
## [SVM classification](https://github.com/smd519/Analytics/blob/main/Cross_Validation_for_Classifer_Methods.md)
 To classify customers on credit approval based on credit history using Credit Approval Data Set.
 
## [k-means clustering](https://github.com/smd519/Analytics/blob/main/kmeansClustering.md)

## [Exponential smoothing](https://github.com/smd519/Analytics/blob/main/Exponential_Smoothing.md)
 To decompose time series, and explore if summer season is getting longer using weather records for Atlanta from 1996 through 2015
 
## [Principal component Analysis](https://github.com/smd519/Analytics/blob/main/Principal_Component_Analysis.md)
